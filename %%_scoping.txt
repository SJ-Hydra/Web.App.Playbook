[ ] How many external (public) IP addresses would you like tested security flaws?

[ ] Could you describe the services you expect to be in use? (e.g. Web Servers)

[ ] Would you like social engineering testing? This could include phishing or vishing in addition to external tests.

[ ] Is there log-in functionality in use? 
	[ ] Are there different roles?  Could you describe the different roles in use?

[ ] Are there functions of the application that you'd like avoided?
