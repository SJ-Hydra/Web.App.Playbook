## Greetings

[ ] What are you looking for from a technical assurance perspective?  What are your security testing goals?
   
[ ] Can you describe the systems you'd like tested?

## Internals
## "Internals" are considered internal network penetration tests. Typically, you would provide some form of internal network access, for instance through a VPN or by permitting the delivery of a remote testing laptop. Typically black box.
[ ] How big is your network; how many IPs are there? 
	[ ] How many workstations do you have? Servers? 
		[ ] How many email servers?
		[ ] How many web servers?
		[ ] How many database servers?
	
[ ] What is your domain administration look like? 
	[ ] How many domain controllers? 
	
[ ] What is your password policy?
	[ ] Character length?  
	[ ] Number of failed attempts for lockout?  Lockout duration?
	[ ] Min age?

[ ] Do you have VOIP deployed?

[ ] What are the operating systems within the environment?

[ ] Are there applications within the internal environment that provide access to the domain?

[ ] Where is the network physically located - on premises or cloud hosted? 
	[ ] If multiple locations, how is it logically connected?

[ ] How many network devices do you have?
	[ ] Switches? Routers? Firewalls?

[ ] Are there any sensitive areas of the network that are deemed critical? 

## Externals
## "Externals" are considered external scans for exposed infrasture services avaliable to the world. For example, the incorrect use of ports or protocols associated with desired services (e.g. FTP use rather than SFTP). 

[ ] How many external (public) IP addresses would you like tested security flaws?

[ ] Could you describe the services you expect to be in use? (e.g. Web Servers)

[ ] Would you like social engineering testing? This could include phishing or vishing in addition to external tests. 

[ ] How in-depth would you like your web applications looked at?

## Web Applications
## Web app testing is considered web site testing.  Typically grey box. 
[ ] Can you describe the purpose of web application(s) in use?

[ ] Would you describe the technology stack?

[ ] Are there security products in use?  Could you 

[ ] Would you like white, grey, or black box testing for the application?

[ ] Is there log-in functionality in use? 
	[ ] Are there different roles?  Could you describe the different roles in use?

[ ] Are there functions of the application that you'd like avoided?

[ ] Are these APIs in use?
	[ ] Do you have well documented API calls? (Postman file, WSDL file, etc.)

[ ] Do you want in-depth testing on API?

## API Testing
## API testing concerns examining the API calls in depth. It is a very labor intense process that involves fuzzing the parameters of each untrusted data field within each API call. 

## Social Engineering
## Social engineering testing is conducted through vishing and phishing targeted employees in order to assess their security awareness training.

[ ] How many employees would you like assessed?  A sample size of the workforce?

[ ] What are your goals for the social engineering testing?  Clicks, credential harvesting, or code execution on end-points?

[ ] Would you be able to facilitate testing by either (1) checking user traffic or (2) facilitating phishing delivery?
