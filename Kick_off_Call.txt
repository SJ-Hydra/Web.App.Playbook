## Penetration Web Application Test Kick-off Discussion/Questions

## Review scope, authorization form

## This test will be coducted over the <timeframe>. During the extent of the timeframe, I will be performing a number of automated and manual tests on the application.  This will include running automated tools, like Nessus, Nikto, and Nmap and performing user-input field fuzzing. In addition, the application will be examined for misconfigurations that permits a user to circumvent security controls.
